# UI Elements

## Abstract

This MEP lays out a design for a user interface (UI) module, `marimo.ui`, which
provides a library of pre-fabricated UI elements that programmers
can use in their apps. The main concerns of the design are:

- the designation of a UI element as an HTML element with a value
- synchronizing a UI element's value in the frontend with its value in the
  kernel
- syncronizing a UI element's appearance when it is shown multiple times
  within an app
- syntax for accessing a UI element's value
- extensibility, or how to make custom elements

## Motivation

Marimo stands out from traditional paradigms for interactive computing in two
important ways: it is *reactive*, functioning like a spreadsheet, and
*interactive*, with UI elements rendered in one cell able to seamlessly control
the execution of other cells via reactivity. While some commercial business
analysis tools provide this functionality in ad-hoc ways, to our knowledge no
tool like marimo (open-source or otherwise) exists for Python developers. In
particular, no tool provides a pure Python experience, in which both
applications and experiments are built using an extensible, modular, and
composable programming framework.

## Criteria
Enabling data scientists to build powerful apps is one of marimo's twin
purposes. For this reason, it is critical that marimo's support for UI elements
is carefully designed.

We strive for a design that satisfies the following
criteria:

- *seamless*: accessing a UI element's value must be seamless; no callbacks
- *Pythonic*: creating, displaying, and reading UI elements should be Pythonic
- *no web programming*: 99 percent of users shouldn't need to write any HTML,
                        Javascript, or CSS
- *extensible*: it should be easy for developers to implement custom UI
  elements, using web technologies of their choice
- *custom styles*: the styling of UI elements should be customizable

## HTML objects with values
This MEP is about UI elements, or HTML elements that have _values_;
these values may change when the element is interacted with.

Many HTML objects have no concept of a value; for example, markdown, or plain
text, or embedded videos, are just content. A UI element is different: for
example, a slider has a numeric value, a text form has a string value, and a
file upload box has a bytes value. This distinction is important enough to
merit the creation of a type specific to UI elements.

### The `UIElement` type

A `UIElement` is an `HTML` element that has a `value` attribute. This value can
be set at creation time by the user, to designate a default value for the
element; after creation, `value` cannot be changed by Python code.

**Frontend synchronization.** When the value of a rendered `UIElement` changes,
all other instances of the element that are rendered in the frontend have their
value updated as well. This ensures that the frontend remains consistent.

**Kernel synchronization**. Interacting with a rendered `UIElement` in the
frontend may change the `value` attribute on the Python object; when the value
is updated, every cell referencing the `UIElement` object is run reactively.
This enables interactivity to drive execution of other cells.

### Input elements

An important subclass of UI elements are the [HTML input
elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).
These are UI elements the modern browsers provide out-of-the-box, and can be
constructed with just a few lines of HTML.

These elements have a well-defined event model: any ...

### Other UI elements

There are many other kinds of UI elements that are not, however, input elements.
For example, a D3 visualization, an image with a bounding box selector, or
a webcam screenshotter are all UI elements but are not HTML input elements.
Their interactivity is not furnished by the browser, but by custom Javascript
code. _Our design must also accommodate these elements._
