# UI Elements

## Abstract

This MEP lays out a design for a user interface (UI) module, `marimo.ui`, which
provides a library of pre-fabricated UI elements that programmers
can use in their apps. The main concerns of the design are:

- a UI element as an HTML element with a value
- synchronizing a UI element's value in the frontend with its value in the
  kernel
- syncronizing a UI element's appearance when it is shown multiple times
  within an app
- syntax for accessing a UI element's value
- extensibility, or how to make custom elements

## Motivation

Marimo stands out from traditional paradigms for interactive computing in a few
important ways: it is *reactive*, functioning like a spreadsheet,
*interactive*, with UI elements rendered in one cell able to seamlessly control
the execution of other cells via reactivity, and *extensible*, with the ability
to make custom UI elements as well as make any Python object render as a UI
element. While some open-source libraries and commercial editing tools provide
subsets of this functionality in ad-hoc ways, to our knowledge no tool like
marimo (open-source or otherwise) exists for Python developers. In particular,
no tool provides a pure Python experience, in which both experiments and
applications are built using an extensible, modular, and composable programming
framework.

Enabling data scientists to build powerful apps is one of marimo's twin
purposes. For this reason, it is critical that marimo's support for UI elements
is carefully designed.

## Criteria
We strive for a design that satisfies the following criteria:

- *seamless*: accessing a UI element's value must be seamless; no callbacks
- *Pythonic*: creating, displaying, and reading UI elements should be Pythonic
- *no web programming*: 99 percent of users shouldn't need to write any HTML,
                        Javascript, or CSS
- *extensible*: it should be easy for developers to implement custom UI
  elements, using web technologies of their choice

A big plus, but not a requirement for now, is the following:
- *customizable*: the styling of UI elements should be customizable

## UI elements: HTML objects with values
A UI element is an HTML element that has a _value_.
Its value may change when interacted with.

Many HTML elements do not have values; for example, markdown, or plain
text, or embedded videos, are just content. A UI element is different: for
example, a slider has a numeric value, a text form has a string value, and a
file upload box has a bytes value. This distinction is important enough to
merit the creation of a type specific to UI elements.

### The `UIElement` type

A `UIElement` is an `HTML` element that has a `value` attribute. This value can
be set at creation time by the user, to designate a default value for the
element; after creation, `value` cannot be changed by Python code.

**Frontend synchronization.** When the value of a rendered `UIElement` changes,
all other instances of the element that are rendered in the frontend have their
value updated as well. This ensures that the frontend remains consistent.

**Kernel synchronization**. Interacting with a rendered `UIElement` in the
frontend may change the `value` attribute on the Python object; when the value
is updated, every cell referencing the `UIElement` object is run reactively,
_except_ the cell that created the `UIElement`.
This enables interactivity to drive execution of other cells.

_Why not run the creating cell?_ If the cell that created the `UIElement` were
run upon interaction, then the `UIElement` would be reconstructed
and re-initialized with its default value, which would effectively
undo the effect of interacting with the element.

This can lead to confusing behavior: for example, consider the following cell

```python
# this cell won't do what its author wanted it to do ...
slider = mo.ui.slider(start=1, stop=10)
x = slider.value
slider
```

Interacting with the emitted slider will _not_ update the value of `x`, since
this cell creates `slider` and therefore it won't be triggered by the
interaction.

_Disallow accessing `value` before a UIElement is shown._ To mitigate this
confusing behavior, we will raise an exception when a `UIElement`s value is
accessed before the element is shown on the page.

### Input elements

An important subclass of UI elements are the [HTML input
elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).
These are UI elements the modern browsers provide out-of-the-box, and can be
constructed with just a few lines of HTML.

Every input element has a [value
attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value)
that stores its current value; some have special attributes (such as 'checked'
for checkboxes) that contain additional information. An input event is fired
whenever the value is changed.

#### Library of included elements

**Slider.** A numeric slider that displays the currently selected number.

**Number.** A field for numbers that has increment/decrement buttons, a min
and max, and the ability to type in a number; typing in a number out of bounds
will display an error message.

**Text.** A single-line text input area.

**Text area.** A multi-line text input area.

**Toggle.** A single boolean switch.

**Checkbox.** A group of toggles, with any number being selectable.

**Radio.** A group of radio buttons, with at most one being selectable.

**Drop-down.** HTML select. 

**File upload.**

**Form.** A collection of UI elements, together with a submit button, whose
value is dict with an entry for each element. The value is only sent when the
submit button is clicked.

### Other UI elements

There are many other kinds of UI elements that are not input elements.
For example, a D3 visualization, an image with a bounding box selector, or
a webcam screenshotter are all UI elements but are not HTML input elements.
Their interactivity is not furnished by the browser, but by custom Javascript
code. Our design must have also support these other elements.

XXX: implement in separate .js/.ts file, package into a library? write raw
HTML/javascript in python?

## Examples


```python
slider = mo.ui.slider(start=1, stop=10, step=1)
slider
```

```python
slider.value
```


## Implementation

### Implementing simple UI Elements within Python
**The `UIElement` class**. We introduce a `UIElement` class for elements
whose frontend code is simple enough to include as a string within Python.
This makes it very easy to create simple components, at the cost of being
unwieldy to develop more complex ones.

XXX how does the value show up in the HTML?
```python
class UIElement(formatting.MIME):
  def __init__(self, html: str, initial_value: Optional[Any] = None) -> None:
    self.html = html
    self._value = initial_value
    
  @property
  def value(self) -> Any:
    return self._value

  def __mime__(self) -> tuple[str, str]:
    return (
      "text/html",
       (
          f'<UIElement objectId="{id(self)}}">'
          + self.html
          + '</UIElement>'
       ),
    )
  
  def __format__(self, spec: str) -> str:
    del spec
    return formatting.as_html(*self.__mime__())
```
In a future MEP, we will introduce a mechanism for registering UI elements that
were implemented entirely outside of Python (using raw HTML and Javascript, or
frontend frameworks); in this mechanism, Python code will forward
arguments to the frontend instead of generating and sending HTML; the frontend
will then instantiate the requested component on the kernel's behalf.

**Generated HTML.** The HTML generated for a UI element is wrapped in a
special tag, `<UIElement>`. This element carries an attribute called
`objectId` which contains the Python object `id` of the corresponding
`UIElement` object.

The `objectId` attribute uniquely identifies a frontend UI element, and will be
used to synchronize the values of multiply rendered elements within the
frontend. It will also be used to identify which UI element in the kernel needs
to have its value updated upon interaction.

### Frontend synchronization

### Kernel synchronization

**Kernel synchronization.**  The `object-id` attribute of the generated HTML
will be used to find the corresponding `UIElement` in the kernel, and to
trigger reactive execution of cells that refer to it.

## XXX Scratch

We would like a single API for all UI elements, for synchronizing them on the
frontend as well as communicating values back to Python.

The current implementation does one thing for certain kinds of inputs, and
another thing for other inputs (`setInputValue` and `getInputValue`). To me it
seems this logic should be pushed down into the individual `UIElements`: the
elements, not the marimo frontend, should decide how values are incorporated
into them.

That seems like  a reasonable premise. So starting with that premise ...
how _do_ we synchronize multiple instances of a UI element in the frontend, and
how do we communicate values back to Python?

**Case 1.** UIElements embedded in iframes. Then use `window.postMessage` 
to propagate a message up to the marimo frontend, and include whatever
information is needed to forward value to Python as well as sync with other
copies of the UI Element.

How does sync-ing with other copies of the UI Element work? Let's consider a
copy, meaning an iframe with some content inside it. We'll need to reach into
the iframe and set some attribute, or send it some sort of message, or
something, if that's possible (looks like it is possible to post a message to
an iframe).

so, say a UI element is interacted with. it sends a message to the frontend
saying "i've been interacted with -- here's my id, here's my new value,  do
what you will with this information". the frontend picks up this message, then
(1) sends a new message to each copy of the element on the page, and (2) sends
the value to the Python kernel.

When a UI element's iframe receives a message (containing a new value) from the
main page, ... it needs to somehow notify the component that its value has been
updated. Maybe every UI element needs to be wrapped in a dummy <UIElement>
tag, and we dispatch an event on that tag. Or maybe we just set a value
attribute on the first element child, or something. Basically the HTML
needs to have _something_ we can either dispatch an event to or set an
attribute on (with a custom setter used to react to the value changing). This
_something_ needs to be contractually agreed upon.

**Case 2.**
