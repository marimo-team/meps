# marimo.ui

## Abstract

This MEP lays out a design for a user interface module, `marimo.ui`, which
provides a library of pre-fabricated user interface elements that programmers
can use in their apps. The main concerns of the design are:

- the concept of a UI element's value: which HTML elements have values?
- synchronizing a UI element's value in the frontend and its value in the
  kernel
- synchronization of a UI element's appearance when it is shown multiple times
  within an app
- syntax for accessing a UI elements value within an app
- extensibility and design of custom elements

## Motivation

Marimo stands out from traditional paradigms for interactive computing in two
important ways: it is *reactive*, functioning like a spreadsheet, and
*interactive*, with UI elements rendered in one cell able to seamlessly control
the execution of other cells. Nothing like marimo exists for Python developers
today.

The coupling of reactivity and interactivity is the foundation of modern web
apps; because enabling data scientists to build powerful apps is one of
marimo's two primary purposes, it is absolutely critical that marimo's support
for user interface elements is very carefully designed.

## Criteria
- *seamless*: accessing a UI element's value must be _seamless_; no callbacks,
  no registration of event handlers, no update functions ...
- *Pythonic*: creating, displaying, and a reading a value from a UI element
              should be Pythonic
- *no web programming*: 99 percent of users shouldn't need to write any HTML,
                        Javascript, or CSS
- *custom styles*: the styling of UI elements should be customizable
- *extensible*: it should be easy for developers to implement custom UI
  elements

## HTML objects with values
This document is about UI elements, or HTML elements that have _values_,
and whose values may change when the element is interacted with. Many HTML
objects have no concept of a value; for example, markdown, or plain text, or
embedded videos, are just content. A UI element is different: for example, a
slider has a numeric value, a text form has a string value, and a file upload
box has a bytes value.

A large subclass of UI elements are the _HTML input elements_.

XXX

There are many other kinds of UI elements that are not, however, input elements.
For example, a D3 visualization, an image with a bounding box selector, or
a webcam screenshotter are all UI elements but are not HTML input elements.
Their interactivity is not furnished by the browser, but by custom Javascript
code. _Our design must also accommodate these elements._
