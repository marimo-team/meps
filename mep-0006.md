# Callable Cells

## Abstract

This MEP proposes an API for accessing a notebook's cells as callable functions
from its `App` object.


## Motivation

Today, notebook users often find themselves copy-pasting cells from one notebook
to another, a tedious and error-prone process. This MEP describes one way to
make code written in marimo notebooks more re-usable and testable: by exposing
named cells in a notebook as callable objects.

## Criteria

- Pythonic: named cells should be usable like any other Python object
- The visual output of a cell must be made available after calling the function
- Users shouldn't need to pass in all of a cell's refs (such as imported modules)
- Refs should be parametrizable (replaced) by the user

## Design

Since cells are defined at the top-level of a module, they can be imported
like with any other Python module. For example:

```
from my_notebook import my_cell
```

A `Cell` represents a notebook cell. It is a callable function, with the
following API:

```python
@dataclass
class Cell:

    # the name of the function
    name: str

    def __call__(self, *args) -> tuple[Any, ...]:
        ...

    # XXX or `compute`
    def run(self, **kwargs) -> Callable[..., tuple[Any, dict[str, Any]]]:
        ...
```

**The `__call__` method**

The call method takes as arguments the cell's refs, and returns
a tuple of its defs. This matches the file format, but likely
won't be very useful. Instead users should use `run`.

**The `run`**

The `run` method runs a cell, returning a tuple of its outputs and defs
(XXX or a `Result` object?). The main thing to note about this function is
its arugments:
- Any keyword args whose names match any of the cell's refs are inserted into
  the cell's namespace before it is executed.
- Any refs not matched against the keyword arguments are computed by executing
  the DAG.

In this way, users can re-use a cell from another notebook without having to
worry about the semantics of its refs, which can be difficult to figure out in
some cases and cumbersome in others (e.g., in the case of refs that are
imported modules). Still, the ability to customize ref values is useful, as it
lets the user customize the behavior of the cell for their own use case.

```python
from my_notebook import cell

# implictly compute all the cell's refs before calling
output, defs = cell.run()

# specify the value for some refs
output, defs = cell.run(slider=mo.ui.slider(1, 10), x=1)
```

XXX caching of defs?

**Asynchronous cells.** If a cell uses top-level await, both `__call__` and
`run` will automatically execute it as a coroutine and obtain its value on the
users behalf. This keeps the API simple, otherwise we would need an `AsyncCell`
object with `async` methods (XXX maybe that would be fine ...?)


## Implementation

XXX today the `app.cell` decorator currently returns a `Cell` object with many internal
methods;  we'll need to clean that up

XXX `cell.run()` will reach into the kernel context to find the kernel and
hook into its DAG

## Evaluation

> Pythonic

- [x] Importable like any other Python symbol
