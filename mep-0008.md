## Abstract

marimo notebooks are Python files, which ideally allow them to be used like regular Python modules.
However, defining reusable functions in a notebook is cumbersome.
Users cannot naturally define a top-level function and import it from the notebook;
instead, they have to rely on marimo’s internal cell API or other workarounds.
This proposal introduces `app.function` to enable natural, top-level function definitions within marimo notebooks that can be imported and used like normal Python functions.

## Motivation

Currently, if a user wants to share logic (e.g., a utility function) from a notebook, they face limitations.
The only straightforward way to reuse a function defined in a notebook cell was to run that notebook and possibly access the function via the app object or cell outputs, or use a low-level API to retrieve it.
`app.embed` is available, but this is targeted towards reusing outputs and not logic.
As is, to run a function defined by a notebook, the following pattern is required:

```python
from my_notebook import named_cell

def wrap_cell_function(cell, fn_name):
    _outputs, defs = cell.run()
    return defs[fn_name]

my_function = wrap_cell_function(named_cell, 'my_function')
my_function()
```

## Criteria

Ideally, the following should be enabled:

```python
from my_notebook import my_function

my_result = my_function()
```

Moreover, these criteria are ideal:

 - Should not be confusing to any level of user.
 - Should be easy to maintain as a script and from the notebook interface.
 - Should allow for library imports to be used within the function.
 - Should be usable by other programs (e.g., pytest).

## Background

The work towards top-level functions has already seen a fair amount of progress.
 - Cells can be directly called if all the dependencies are provided: https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/pull/3251
 - The `app.function` decorator is already implemented: https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/pull/3755
 - Top-level imports allow `@app.function` to be useful: https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/pull/3779
 - There are pytest-specific tweaks for usage in testing: https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/pull/3294

For reading and discussion up to this point, refer to the following conversations.

As is, marimo notebooks are serialized as:

```python
# Header comments are preserved.                    # | Header comments.

import marimo                                       # | marimo import

with marimo.import_guard():                         # | Import definitions (unsettled, see below)
    # Imports used by your notebook's top-level functions.   # |- Import copy
    # This section is automatically generated by marimo.     # ||
    import textwrap                                 # |- Import block
                                                    # ||
    import marimo as mo                             # ||


__generated_with = "0.0.0"                          # | Metadata
app = marimo.App(_toplevel_fn=True)                 # | App init


@app.cell                                           # | Body
def normal_cell():                                  # |- Cell definition
    # General cell as per normal marimo behavior.   # ||
    A = 1                                           # ||
    def_that_uses_imports()                         # ||
    return A                                        # ||
                                                    # |
                                                    # |
@app.function                                       # |- Function definition
# Doubles as a function definition and a cell.      # ||
def def_that_uses_imports():                        # ||
    return mo.md(textwrap.dedent(                   # ||
        "    Hello there!"                          # ||
    ))                                              # ||
                                                    # |
                                                    # |
@app.cell                                           # |- Duplicated imports
def import_cell():                                  # ||
    import marimo as mo                             # ||
    import textwrap                                 # ||
    return textwrap, mo                             # ||


if __name__ == "__main__":                          # | Footer
    app.run()                                       # |
```

Header, marimo import, metadata, and footer are preserved. However, top-level functions require a new `app.function` decorator in the body and top-level imports in the new Import Definitions block.
This document is to facilitate the conversation around three remaining concerns required to remove the experimental `_toplevel_fn` flag:

1. [Communication](#communication)
2. [Serialization](#serialization)
3. [Security](#security)

<!---->
## Communication
<!---->
Communication comes down to two things: Docs and UX.

### Documentation
A cursory glance through the current documentation shows that the only page discussing the file format comes from [guides/editors](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/editor_features/watching/).
Additionally, there is the [file format tutorial]( https://marimo.app/?slug=8n55fd), which is a bit outdated.

Suggestions:
 - It seems reasonable to refresh the file format tutorial: (See work in progress https://marimo.app/l/0u57k9)
 - Update the editor feature page to mention the new `app.function` feature.
 - Create a new page discussing code reuse/using marimo as a library.

### User Experience
#### Script
The script UX is relatively straightforward since the user must know about the functionality to utilize it.
However, the top-level imports may be confusing to some, and the import copy may need work.
The intent of the copy is to:
1. Dissuade users from editing the block.
2. Make it clear that marimo files can still be edited.

#### Editor
Top-level function changes, having visual indications in script form, need a visual indicator in the editor.
There are two categories in how we can communicate top-level function information in the editor:

#### Unmanaged

The criteria for `@app.function` serialization are:
1. Only imported references or other top-level function references are allowed.
2. The cell must only contain a single function definition.

If the function meets the criteria, then serialization in `app.function` form automatically occurs.
This UX is "unmanaged" because it does not require user input.
This is currently how `app.function` is implemented, but there is no visual indicator in the editor.

**Benefits:**
 - Implicit conversion means one less step when defining a library.
 - No confusion pitfalls for new users since it does not impact normal notebook behavior.

**Disadvantages:**
 - If a user wants to define a function as a top-level function but cannot, this may cause frustration.
   This can be mitigated by showing a warning if a cell is close to being a top-level function but not quite there.

**Suggestion**:

Show the function in output if it is standalone:

![Shows open code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca04c490-59dc-4f7c-8324-766af771620e)

Add a tooltip by definition if the function does not meet criteria:

![Shows tooltip on lambda](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dd64ef8-8727-42ad-ac40-71495e4c3afb)

Allow `hide_output` on the cell level.

````python {.marimo hide_output=true}
mo.md(
    r"""
    <details>
    <summary>
    ```python
    def increment(val: int) -> int:
    ```
    </summary>
    ```python
        '''Adds one to an integer

        Args:
          val: int

        Returns:
          val + 1
        '''
    ```
    </details>
    """
)
````

#### Managed

marimo currently has special cells on the front end.  
A "managed" UX would defer the special cell type to the user.  
However, unlike Markdown or SQL special cells, the function signature and body are part of the resultant serialization, and it's possible to create invalid cells.

As such, marimo must prevent the user from saving in "function mode" if the body is invalid.  
Similar to how `app.unparsable` works, an invalid function block may get serialized as:

```python
@app.unparsable_function("""
def my_function() # no colon for example
    pass
print(1) # or statements out of the function block
""")
```

**Benefits:**
 - Users have explicit control of `app.function`.

**Disadvantages:**
 - Inexperienced users may get stuck in the mode and not understand why the cell doesn't run.
 - Possible to save a function with a reference to something else in the notebook, which will cause a `NameError` when actually run.  
   This could be mitigated by a warning when saving but may still be confusing.
 - Additional metadata on the cell level is required to distinguish between the two modes.

**UX Suggestion:**

![Shows option to move to function mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8618816c-2a3e-4e3b-b3dd-776f3c354bc2)

Just another "mode":

![Shows function mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d0ebef5-e2e2-40a5-99c1-fccc220627f3)

---

**Suggestion:**  
 - Let's stick to **unmanaged** for now, as it's consistent with how Markdown and SQL cells work.

---

## Serialization

As noted above, the import block serialization is not yet settled.  
Here are a couple of suggestions:

### Comment Separator

```python
# These imports are auto-generated by marimo.
# Try modifying the source cell definitions,
# as opposed to the following block.
import pytest

import marimo

__generated_with = "0.0.0"
# ...
```

[Working implementation and relevant test](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/pull/3779/files/db9d2578625f7b9d39d3dafa27b85d4329a81673#diff-339016dabb337751a0636e1c054e0fb97a11a6dd09185845dde365f47652b3d3R3-R8)

**Pros:**
 - Looks nice.
 - No linter issues.

**Cons:**
 - Import order does not ensure `marimo` is first on format.
 - Brittle detection.

### `if` Separator

```python
import marimo

if marimo.import_guard():
    # This section is auto-generated by marimo.
    import io
    import textwrap
    import marimo as mo
    import typing
    from pathlib import Path

__generated_with = "0.0.0"
```

[Working implementation and relevant test](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/pull/3779/commits/7db678f9754dde74d8de3552dec6fd4f531bc1dc#diff-f0ce04493f0124e1c100939808ef5291bd6df9b32724091bbc9e360f29a6fb22R7-R15)

**Pros:**
 - Conditionally allows imports.
 - Easy to detect.

**Cons:**
 - All or nothing.
 - Some linters may complain that the imports may not be defined.

### `with` Separator

```python
import marimo

with marimo.import_guard():
    # These imports are auto-generated by marimo.
    # Try modifying the source cell definitions
    # as opposed to the following block.
    import pytest

__generated_with = "0.0.0"
```

[Working implementation and relevant test](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/pull/3779/commits/36aa98e56daf687d4d89115e409dc744cdd9a0b3#diff-f0ce04493f0124e1c100939808ef5291bd6df9b32724091bbc9e360f29a6fb22R7-R17)

**Pros:**
 - Granularly allows imports.
 - Easy to detect.

**Cons:**
 - `with` block skips are a bit of a hack and may be confusing.
 - Some linters might complain about shadowed/duplicate imports.

---

## Security

Allowing external imports prior to runtime initialization is a security risk.  
The `with` block allows some mitigation by potentially selectively allowing imports,  
but in the comment guard and `if` block, the imports are always allowed.

**Suggestion:**  
Marimo should move to a **static analysis model** for runtime initialization in edit mode.  
Long-term, if marimo ever wants to support plugins, a user config flag with a security explanation could enable the module load behavior.  
In this case, the `with` context block could still be used to limit imports.

Currently, you can run `marimo edit` on any script, and have the  
top-level definitions execute because marimo really is "just Python."  
However, serializing to a state where an import could prevent runtime is a security risk.

This does make it potentially a **breaking change** if users have been capitalizing on this behavior.

---

## Other Top-Level Definitions

### Classes

This seems totally reasonable with the same constraints as functions.  
**Suggestion:** `@app.class_definition`

### Constants

The proposal here is to put them in another module.

Ease of top-level imports exists because the groundwork for "import-only cells" is already in place.  
While static detection of a constant-only cell is possible, the boundary between what is acceptable and what is not is unclear.  
For instance:

```python
CONST = 1
```

But what about:

```python
CONST = 1
OTHER = 3
DEP = CONST + OTHER
```

The latter seems reasonable since it is only using primitives/primitive operations.  
However, lists (which are mutable) complicate things.  
Plus, there's no such thing as true constants in Python (reassignment is always possible).

Moreover, constants are imported from other modules frequently, and it seems like behavior this should want to support.  
Exposing imports top-level is OK—because while it is possible to indirectly import a value, it is highly discouraged.

**Suggestion:** Leave as is, to maintain simplicity and avoid confusion.

### Import Blocks

Currently, import blocks are implicitly a special cell type.  
It makes sense that marimo would want to denote this as follows:

```python
@app.imports
def my_imports():
    import os
    import sys
    return os, sys
```

However, implementing this would have the exact same behavior as cells.  
It also doesn't enable any new functionality.

```python {.marimo}
import this
```

> There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.

Essentially, it's **syntactic sugar** with no added value.

I think a similar argument goes for:

```python
@app.md(hide_code=True)
def _():
    return """
        # How marimo notebooks run
        Reactive execution is based on a single rule: when a cell is run, all other
        cells that reference any of the global variables it defines run
        automatically.
    """
# maybe even no return, or
app.md("""
    # How marimo notebooks run
""", **kwargs)
```

```python
@app.sql
def _(my_table):
    return """
        select * from my_table;
    """
```

---

## Alternatives Considered

An alternate suggestion was to import the entire notebook module and access the function via a cell name (e.g., `import my_notebook; my_notebook.my_cell.my_function`).  
I don't think that top-level functions discount this. There are reasonable cases where this may be useful.

---

## Future?

Top-level functions could tidy up the notebook interface for exposing to other "Flask"-type applications like FastAPI.  
Consider:

```python
with marimo.import_guard():
    import marimo.fastapi_adapter as fa  # Maybe external plugin allowed too?

@app.function
@fa.get("/api/v1/my_function")
def my_function():
    return "Hello there!"
```

Or even with the current proposed [MCP API](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/pull/3680/files#diff-f808acbb35cb39cd3754ac18b8ffa4ffe9ff12630f53e9573fb218c48890b5bfR1):

```python
with marimo.import_guard():
    import marimo.mcp.servers.dynamic_namespace.my_server as server

@app.function
@server.tool()
def random_number():
    return random.randint(1, 100)

@app.function
@server.prompt()
def what_are_my_tools():
    return "List the tools I have"
```

Decoration at this level allows for the script to be more expressive and functional.  
Where `python my_script.py --plugin=mcp|fastapi` could turn on plugin-level behavior.

## Imports

```python {.marimo}
import marimo as mo
```
